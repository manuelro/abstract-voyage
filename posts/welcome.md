# Abstractions over concretions
> The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. â€” **Edsger Dijkstra**

Welcome to the journal of [Manuel Cerdas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelro/), a Senior Software Engineer with great passion for Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Web Technologies.

In this space you will find articles on introspections about technical and philosophical topics, hosted under this very same domain, and also references to external articles hosted under the [Medium](https://abstractvoyage.medium.com/) domain, authored by myself. You can also visit [open sourced experiments](https://codepen.io/manuelro) on user interfaces development.
